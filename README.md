This project aimed to create an visually engaging analysis of the Human
Development Index (HDI) across subnational regions in four major
countries: China, India, Mexico, and Brazil. By
focusing on subnational regions, this analysis provides a comprehensive
view of the socio-economic landscape, identifying pockets of both
advancement and deprivation.
