This project, completed in R, aimed to generate a visually captivating analysis of the Human Development Index (HDI) across subnational regions in five large and diverse developing countries: China, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Indonesia.  By focusing on subnational differences, the analysis sought to offer a comprehensive perspective of the socio-economic situation within these 5 countries, showcasing both overarching trends and localized pockets of progress and deprivation that might be obscured in broader national-level analyses.
